Github is a hosting service for your Git respositories.

Let's create a new repository at Github:
1) Go to https://www.github.com and signup/login

2) Click on the "+" button at top right corner and select "New resporitory"
3) Choose a respository name. (You can leave other fields blank for now)
4) You will be redirected automatically to a page, where you can find all the required information to continue your next page.

There are other hosting services like GitHub, such as BitBucket.
