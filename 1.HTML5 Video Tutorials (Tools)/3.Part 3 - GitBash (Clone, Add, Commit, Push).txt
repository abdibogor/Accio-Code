After Committing the changes, the next step is pushing the local repository to the Git Server on a remote location (such as Github or Bitbucket)

After creating a remote repository we have the foloowing options:
1) The download(clone) the repository and start making changes.
2) To initialize a local repository and then connect it with the remote one.

The clone command is used to download a remote repository:
e.g $ git clone https://www.github.com/user/project_name.git
Cloning should be done at the very start of the project

if you have already initialized a local repository, you can connect it to the remote one using the following command:
e.g $ git remote add origin https://www.github.com/user/project_name.git

Pushing Remotely 
After making our local changes and commits, its time to push the changes to the remote repository.
The push command tells Git where to puts our commits.
$ git push -u origin master

The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master.
The -u tells Git to remember the parameters so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do.
Also, keep in mind that it is not mandatory to push your project to a remote location.
You are free to work on your project alone without pushing it anywhere, if you need to.
